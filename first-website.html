                <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
                <p>Because life is short and I'd like to spend it learning.
                    I'm not a programmer or engineer by trade but technology
                    facinates me. I want to understand computers from the hardware
                    to the OS to the software to networking. Basically all of it.
                    I think a strong understanding of web development is the right way to go.

                <h2>What is my timeline like?</h2>
                <p>Commitment is one of the harder areas for me. I have trouble
                    with picking things up and putting them down again. I'd like
                    to see this thing through in a year. I think with consistent
                    practice I could get through this curriculum within that timeframe.
